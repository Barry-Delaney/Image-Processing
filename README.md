# Image-Processing
KCF with Python 3.7
####
    This project comes from my term project in the "Digital Image Processing" course, in which I'm going to run
    the KCF algorithm on the NVIDIA Jetson TX1/TX2 platform. Considering the cross-compilation requirements and
    difficulty, I decided to rewrite KCF with Python 3 and maybe consider changing the features utilized by KCF
    to improve its performance in the future.
